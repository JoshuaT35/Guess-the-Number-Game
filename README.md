# Current Features:
1. Currently with over 200 lines of code (some of the lines are from in-line spacing for stylistic purposes)
2. Option to select between 3 difficulties (Easy, Medium and Hard)
3. Option to use hints
4. Option to see a list of numbers that have already been guessed
5. option to ask the play if they want to play again

Ideas I implemented:
1. Used while loops so that a player would eventually give a certain response to every question ask
2. Encapsulated most of the code in a function. This way, the game can repeat just by calling that function
